## Method 1: Via SMS

The simplest method. For SportPesa, send your predictions to the Paybill number 955100. Format your message as JP followed by your picks (1 for Home, X for Draw, 2 for Away). The cost is deducted from your M-Pesa automatically.

## Method 2: Mobile App

Download the official app from Google Play Store (or the website APK for those not on Play Store). Register, deposit via M-Pesa, navigate to the Jackpot section, make your picks, and submit. Most apps give you a confirmation notification.

## Method 3: USSD

Some platforms offer USSD codes that work on any phone, even without internet. Dial the platform's USSD code, follow the prompts, and submit your picks. Payment is via M-Pesa.

## Method 4: Website

Visit the betting platform's website, log in, and navigate to the jackpot section. This gives you the most comfortable interface for making picks and reviewing your selections before submitting.

## Payment Methods

M-Pesa is the standard payment method across all Kenyan betting platforms. Some also accept Airtel Money and bank transfers. Minimum deposits are typically KSH 50-100.

## Important: Only Use Licensed Platforms

Only bet through platforms licensed by the BCLB. Check their website for a list of licensed operators. Never send money to unknown Paybill numbers claiming to offer jackpot bets.
