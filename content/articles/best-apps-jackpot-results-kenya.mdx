## Why You Need a Results App

Jackpot results depend on live football matches across multiple leagues and time zones. You cannot check each match individually. A good results app aggregates everything and notifies you as results come in.

## Official Betting Apps

Every major Kenyan betting platform has its own app. SportPesa and Betika both offer real-time result tracking within their apps. The advantage of using the official app is that your slip is tracked automatically and bonuses are credited instantly.

## Third-Party Results Apps

Apps like FlashScore, SofaScore, and LiveScore provide real-time results across all leagues without being tied to any betting platform. These are essential for pre-match research as they show form, head-to-head, and league tables.

## FlashScore vs SofaScore

FlashScore has faster notifications — results appear within seconds of a goal. SofaScore has better statistical depth — ratings, xG, and advanced metrics. For jackpot players, we recommend having both.

## App Nyumbani (Coming Soon)

We are building a dedicated tool for jackpot research that combines real-time results with strategy testing. Define your own prediction rules and see how they perform against live data. Stay tuned.

## Data Usage Consideration

If mobile data is a concern, FlashScore and SofaScore both have low data usage modes. You can also set them to WiFi-only updates and check results when you connect.
