## The First Thing: Do Not Tell Everyone

The biggest mistake jackpot winners make worldwide is announcing their win to everyone immediately. Before you post on social media or tell extended family, take at least one week to plan. Consult a financial advisor and a lawyer.

## Understanding the Tax

In Kenya, gambling winnings are subject to a 20% withholding tax. This is deducted before you receive your payout. So if you win KSH 100 million, you receive KSH 80 million. Use the planner above to see the exact breakdown for different amounts.

## The 40-25-15-10-10 Rule

Financial advisors recommend a balanced allocation. The planner above uses a proven framework: 40% into investments (stocks, bonds, money market), 25% into real estate, 15% for personal and family needs, 10% emergency fund, and 10% for charity and community.

## Why Investment Matters Most

If you invest KSH 40 million at a conservative 12% annual return (achievable through Kenyan money market funds and government bonds), you earn roughly KSH 400,000 per month in passive income without touching the principal. That is a permanent salary.

## Common Mistakes Winners Make

Buying expensive cars immediately, lending money to everyone who asks, starting businesses without expertise, and making emotional financial decisions in the first month. Every one of these has destroyed jackpot fortunes.

## The Real Win

The real win is not the jackpot amount. It is whether you still have wealth 5 years later. Most lottery winners globally are broke within 3-5 years. Do not become a statistic. Plan before you spend.
