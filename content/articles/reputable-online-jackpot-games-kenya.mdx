## How to Identify a Legitimate Jackpot Platform

The most important thing is licensing. In Kenya, all legal betting companies must be licensed by the Betting Control and Licensing Board (BCLB). If a site is not licensed, do not use it. Your money and personal data are at risk.

## What to Look For

Beyond licensing, check for reliable payment processing (M-Pesa integration is standard in Kenya), transparent rules about jackpot payouts and sharing, active customer support, and a track record of actually paying winners.

## SportPesa

The most established jackpot platform in Kenya. Offers the Midweek (13 games) and Mega (17 games) jackpots. Known for large prize pools and fast payouts. Licensed and regulated.

## Betika

Has grown rapidly with competitive jackpot sizes and strong mobile experience. Their jackpot structure includes generous bonus tiers. Strong M-Pesa integration.

## Other Platforms

mCHEZA, Odibets, and BetWay all offer jackpot products with varying structures. Each has different minimum stakes, game counts, and bonus tiers. Use the comparison tool above to see the differences side by side.

## Red Flags to Avoid

Any site asking for upfront "activation fees," promising guaranteed wins, operating without a visible BCLB license number, or with no traceable physical address in Kenya should be avoided completely.
