## Why You Need a Draw Counter

Before you submit your SportPesa jackpot slip, you should know your draw distribution. Historical analysis of winning jackpot slips shows a consistent pattern — winners typically have between 2 and 5 draws in a 17-game slip.

If your slip has zero draws or 8+ draws, you are statistically outside the winning zone. This free tool lets you check instantly.

## How to Use This Tool

Pick Home (H), Draw (D), or Away (A) for each match. The counter updates in real time, showing you exactly how many of each outcome you have selected and the percentage breakdown.

## What the Numbers Tell You

A balanced slip for the Mega Jackpot (17 games) typically looks like 7-9 home wins, 2-5 draws, and 4-6 away wins. This mirrors the actual distribution of results across the top leagues.

If your picks are heavily skewed in any direction, ask yourself: do you have specific research backing each pick, or are you falling into a pattern bias?

## The Draw Distribution Trap

Many bettors either avoid draws entirely or over-pick them. Both are mistakes. Draws are the hardest outcome to predict, but they happen in roughly 1 out of 4 matches. Ignoring them means you are getting 25% of your slip wrong by default.

Use this counter every time before you submit. It takes 30 seconds and could be the difference between a bonus and nothing.
