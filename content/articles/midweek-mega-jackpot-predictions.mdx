## The Midweek vs Mega Decision

The Midweek Jackpot (13 games, KSH 99) has significantly better odds than the Mega (17 games, KSH 99). Use the calculator above to see the bonus tiers for each. If you are on a budget, the Midweek jackpot offers better value per shilling.

## Step 1: Fixtures Released (Monday/Tuesday)

As soon as fixtures are released, categorise each match into three groups. Confident picks where you have a strong prediction. Toss-up matches where two outcomes are equally likely. Unknown matches where you have no opinion.

## Step 2: Research (Tuesday/Wednesday)

Focus your research time on the toss-up and unknown matches. For confident picks, do a quick confirmation check. For toss-ups, look at form, head-to-head, and injuries to find a lean. For unknowns, check the odds — bookmakers have already done research you can learn from.

## Step 3: Draw Distribution Check

Before finalising your slip, count your draws. If you have zero draws in 17 games, something is wrong. If you have 8+ draws, something is also wrong. The sweet spot is 2-5 draws for the Mega.

## Step 4: Final Review

Look at your slip as a whole. Does it make sense? Are you picking too many favourites? Have you considered any upsets? A winning slip almost always has at least one or two surprising results.

## Step 5: Submit and Move On

Once you submit, do not check results obsessively. Watch the matches if you want to, but the outcome is already determined by your research quality. Save your energy for next round's research.
