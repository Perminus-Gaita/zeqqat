## How We Rate These Sites

We evaluate each platform on five criteria: jackpot variety and prize sizes, payment speed and reliability, mobile experience, customer support responsiveness, and bonus tier generosity. The ratings above reflect our assessment based on these factors.

## SportPesa Review

The original Kenyan jackpot king. Pros include the largest prize pools, proven track record of paying winners, and excellent app. Cons include higher minimum stake compared to some competitors and the jackpot odds being among the hardest due to 17 games.

## Betika Review

Rapidly becoming SportPesa's biggest competitor. Pros include generous bonuses, quick payouts, and a clean mobile interface. Cons include occasional server issues during peak times and less history of mega payouts.

## What Matters Most

For jackpot players specifically, the two most important factors are prize pool size and payout reliability. A platform with smaller jackpots but guaranteed fast payouts may be better than one with huge pools but payment delays.

## Our Recommendation

Use multiple platforms. Each jackpot is independent, so playing the SportPesa Mega Jackpot and the Betika Midweek Jackpot in the same week doubles your chances without doubling your research time since many fixtures overlap.
