## What Is the SportPesa Jackpot?

The SportPesa Jackpot is a football prediction game where you predict the outcomes of 13 (Midweek) or 17 (Mega) football matches. Each match has three possible outcomes: Home Win, Draw, or Away Win. Get all predictions correct and you win the jackpot. Get close and you win a bonus.

The minimum stake is KSH 99. The jackpot prize pool is shared if multiple people win.

## How to Play

You can play via SMS, the SportPesa app, or the website. For detailed instructions on each method, read our guide on [how and where to buy jackpot tickets](/i/buy-lottery-tickets-jackpot-kenya).

## Understanding the Odds

The mathematical probability of winning the Mega Jackpot is 1 in 129 million. The Midweek Jackpot is 1 in 1.6 million. These are tough odds, but they improve significantly with research and double chance picks. Learn more in our article on [the exact odds of winning](/i/odds-winning-sportpesa-jackpot).

## Finding the Right Platform

SportPesa is not the only option. Compare all licensed Kenyan jackpot platforms in our [reputable jackpot sites guide](/i/reputable-online-jackpot-games-kenya) and read our [honest reviews](/i/jackpot-betting-sites-kenya-reviews).

## Tools

## The Bottom Line

The jackpot is extremely difficult to win. No system guarantees it. But smart research, disciplined analysis, and the right tools can improve your hit rate on individual games, which improves bonus tier results and occasionally puts you in position for the big prize.

Play responsibly. Only bet what you can afford to lose. And enjoy the process.
