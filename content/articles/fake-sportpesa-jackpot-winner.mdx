## The Perfect Prank

Everyone has that friend who always talks about winning the jackpot. Now you can beat them to it — at least on WhatsApp.

Use the generator above to create a realistic-looking jackpot winner card with your name and any amount you choose. Screenshot it and send it to your group chat. Watch the chaos unfold.

## How to Make It Convincing

For maximum effect, send the screenshot casually without any text. Let people react first. Then wait at least 10 minutes before revealing it is a joke. The longer you wait, the funnier it gets.

Some winning strategies: Send it at 3am when people are half asleep. Send it right after a real jackpot round when results have just come out. Send it from a new number nobody recognises.

## A Word of Caution

This is purely for fun. Do not use this to scam, deceive for financial gain, or create panic. The card clearly states it is for entertainment purposes. Do not remove that disclaimer. Be a good friend — make people laugh, not stressed.

## Why We Built This

Because betting should have a fun side too. Not everything needs to be serious analysis and probability calculations. Sometimes you just want to make your friends jealous for 10 minutes.
