## Jackpot Taxation in Kenya (2026)

As of July 2025, Kenya uses a **5% withdrawal tax** system (down from 20%).

## How the 5% Tax Works

**On ALL withdrawals**, regardless of amount:

**Example: KSh 200M win**
- Gross winnings: KSh 200,000,000
- Withdrawal tax (5%): KSh 10,000,000
- **Net to M-Pesa: KSh 190,000,000**

## Old vs New System

**Before July 2025 (20% on net):**
- KSh 200M win = KSh 40M tax
- Take-home: KSh 160M

**After July 2025 (5% on all):**
- KSh 200M win = KSh 10M tax
- Take-home: KSh 190M

**Savings: KSh 30M!**
