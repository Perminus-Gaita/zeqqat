## Prize Sharing Rules

If multiple people get 17/17 correct, the jackpot is **split equally**.

**Example:**
- Jackpot: KSh 200M
- Winners: 4 people
- Each receives: KSh 50M (before tax)

## Historical Split Wins

**May 2017:** 3 winners split KSh 111.2M
- Each received: ~KSh 37M

This is the only time in SportPesa history that the Mega Jackpot was split.
