## The Systematic Approach

Consistent winners follow a process, not gut feelings.

## Step 1: Check Team News

- Injuries to key players
- Suspensions
- Confirmed lineups (when available)

## Step 2: Analyze Form

- Last 5 games (not just results, but performance)
- Home vs away form separately
- Goals scored/conceded trends

## Step 3: Review Head-to-Head

- Last 3-5 meetings
- Look for patterns (e.g., always draws, one team dominates)
