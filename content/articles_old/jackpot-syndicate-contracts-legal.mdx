## Legal Status of Syndicates

Betting syndicates are **legal in Kenya** but contracts must be properly structured.

## Essential Contract Elements

**Must include:**
1. All members' names and ID numbers
2. Contribution amounts
3. Profit split formula
4. Who places bets (designated bettor)
5. Dispute resolution process
6. Exit conditions

## Enforcement

Verbal agreements are hard to enforce. Always use **written, signed contracts** witnessed by 2+ people.
