## When Matches Get Postponed

Weather, COVID, stadium issues, or security concerns can postpone matches. Here's what happens to your jackpot bet.

## SportPesa's Official Policy

**If 1-3 matches are postponed:**
- Jackpot continues
- Postponed matches are **voided**
- You only need to predict remaining matches correctly

**If 4+ matches are postponed:**
- Entire jackpot is **cancelled**
- All entries are **refunded** to your account
- Prize pool rolls over to next week

## How Voided Matches Affect Odds

**Example: 17-game Mega Jackpot**

**Scenario 1: 2 matches postponed**
- Remaining games: 15
- New odds: 3^15 = 14,348,907 (vs original 129M)
- **Your odds improve 9× automatically!**

**Scenario 2: 5 matches postponed**
- Jackpot cancelled
- Full refund issued

## What Counts as "Postponed"

**Postponement triggers:**
✅ Match moved to different date
✅ Match cancelled before kickoff
✅ Severe weather preventing play
✅ Stadium safety issues

**NOT postponements:**
❌ Match abandoned after 70+ minutes (result stands based on score at abandonment)
❌ Match delayed by 30-60 minutes (still plays same day)

## Refund Timeline

**When you get refunded:**
- Postponements announced before jackpot deadline: **Immediate refund**
- Postponements announced after deadline: **Refund within 24 hours**

**How refund works:**
- KSh 99 returned to your SportPesa account
- Available immediately for re-betting
- Can withdraw to M-Pesa if desired

## Strategic Considerations

### Should You Bet If Postponements Are Likely?

**Consider postponing your bet if:**
- Bad weather forecast for multiple match locations
- COVID outbreak rumors at multiple clubs
- Political instability in match locations

**Still bet if:**
- Only 1-2 matches at risk (improves your odds)
- Jackpot prize pool is unusually high
- You're confident in remaining fixtures

## Historical Postponement Data

**SportPesa Mega Jackpot (2017-2026):**
- Total jackpots: ~450
- Jackpots with 1-3 postponements: 28 (6%)
- Jackpots fully cancelled (4+ postponements): 3 (0.7%)

**Takeaway:** Postponements are rare but not impossible.

## What Winners Say

From our research, **2 of the 5 Mega Jackpot winners** won during weeks with 1-2 postponed matches.

**Why?** Fewer games = better odds, but most bettors didn't adjust strategies.
