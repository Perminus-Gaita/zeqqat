## AI's Role in Jackpot Research

AI can help with **research** but can't predict match outcomes reliably.

## What AI CAN Do

✅ Summarize team news quickly
✅ Compile head-to-head records
✅ Identify form patterns
✅ Suggest matches to research deeper
✅ Calculate probabilities based on odds

## What AI CANNOT Do

❌ Predict exact match results
❌ Access real-time data (without plugins)
❌ "Hack" bookmaker systems
❌ Guarantee wins

## Best AI accuracy: 50-56% per game

Even top AI models achieve only 50-56% accuracy, same as disciplined human research.

## How to Use AI Effectively

**Prompt example:**
"Analyze Arsenal vs Chelsea fixture based on last 5 games for each team, head-to-head record, and home/away form."

**AI provides:** Summary of data for YOU to interpret.
