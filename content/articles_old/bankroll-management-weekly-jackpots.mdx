## The Golden Rule: Never Bet Rent Money

Jackpots are entertainment, not income. Set a monthly budget you can afford to lose.

## The 5% Rule

**Budget Formula:**
- Monthly entertainment budget: e.g., KSh 2,000
- Jackpot allocation: 40% = KSh 800
- Weekly budget: KSh 200 (2 entries at KSh 99 each)

## Never Chase Losses

Lost 10 weeks in a row? Your odds next week are the same: 1 in 129M. Past losses don't improve future chances.
