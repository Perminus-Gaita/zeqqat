## Double Chance: The Strategic Tool

Used correctly, double chance improves odds. Used poorly, it wastes money.

## The Mathematics

| Double Chance Games | Total Combinations | Cost (KSh) |
|---------------------|-------------------|------------|
| 3 games | 8 (2^3) | 792 |
| 5 games | 32 (2^5) | 3,168 |
| 7 games | 128 (2^7) | 12,672 |
| 10 games | 1,024 (2^10) | 101,376 |

## When to Use Double Chance

**GOOD:** Two outcomes have similar probability
- Example: Everton vs Brighton (Home 38%, Draw 32%, Away 30%)
- Use: Home/Draw double chance (covers 70%)

**BAD:** One outcome is heavily favored
- Example: Man City vs Bournemouth (Home 72%, Draw 18%, Away 10%)
- Use: Single Home pick (save money)
