## The Mental Game

Jackpot betting is 50% strategy, 50% psychology.

## Common Psychological Traps

### Trap 1: The Near-Miss Effect
Getting 16/17 feels like "almost winning" and triggers more betting.

**Reality:** 16/17 IS a win (bonus tier). Celebrate it.

### Trap 2: Gambler's Fallacy
"I've lost 20 weeks, I'm due for a win."

**Reality:** Each week is independent. Past losses don't increase future chances.

## Building Discipline

**1. Set Realistic Expectations**
- Target: 14-16/17 consistently
- Grand prize: Bonus, not expectation

**2. Celebrate Small Wins**
- Hitting 15/17? That's KSh 10K-50K
- Focus on process, not just outcomes
