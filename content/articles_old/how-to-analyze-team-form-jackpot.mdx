## Why Form Analysis Matters

"Last 5 games: WWWWW" looks impressive, but is it meaningful if all 5 wins were against relegation teams?

Real form analysis goes deeper.

## The 5-Layer Form Analysis

### Layer 1: Results (Surface Level)
**What to check:**
- Last 5 results (W/D/L)
- Points from last 5 games
- Win/loss streak

**Example:** Arsenal - WWDWL (10 points from 5 games)

**What this tells you:** Recent momentum direction, but not quality.

---

### Layer 2: Quality of Opposition
**What to check:**
- League position of opponents faced
- Home/away splits
- Strength of schedule

**Example:** 
- Arsenal's 3 wins: vs 18th, 19th, 20th place teams (weak)
- Arsenal's 1 draw: vs 2nd place team (strong)
- Arsenal's 1 loss: vs 5th place team (medium)

**What this tells you:** Arsenal beats weak teams but struggles vs top opposition.

---

### Layer 3: Performance Metrics
**What to check:**
- Goals scored vs expected goals (xG)
- Goals conceded vs expected goals against (xGA)
- Shots on target ratio
- Possession in dangerous areas

**Example:**
- Arsenal xG: 1.8 per game
- Arsenal actual goals: 2.4 per game
- **Interpretation:** Overperforming xG (unsustainable, likely regression coming)

---

### Layer 4: Context & Circumstances
**What to check:**
- Key injuries during period
- Manager changes mid-streak
- Cup fixtures causing rotation
- International break disruption

**Example:** Liverpool WWWWW but no Salah for 3 of those games (AFCON). Is form sustainable when he returns?

---

### Layer 5: Home vs Away Split
**What to check:**
- Separate home/away form
- Travel distance for away games
- Home fortress vs away struggles

**Example:**
- Man Utd home: WWWDW (13 points from 5)
- Man Utd away: LLDLL (1 point from 5)

**What this tells you:** Extreme home/away split = pick accordingly.

## Common Form Analysis Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Over-Weighting Recent Form
**Problem:** Recency bias. One great week doesn't erase months of mediocrity.

**Solution:** Weight last 5 games (60%) + previous 5 games (40%) for fuller picture.

### Mistake 2: Ignoring Fixture Context
**Problem:** WWWWW against bottom 5 teams ≠ WWWWW against top 5 teams.

**Solution:** Always check opponent quality during the streak.

### Mistake 3: Not Checking Home/Away Split
**Problem:** Overall form hides home/away patterns.

**Solution:** Analyze home/away separately, especially for away predictions.

## Practical Form Analysis Checklist

**For Each Team:**
1. ✅ Check last 5 results
2. ✅ Note opponent quality (league positions)
3. ✅ Split home vs away form
4. ✅ Check for key injuries/suspensions
5. ✅ Review goals scored vs xG
6. ✅ Look for streaks (3+ consecutive same result)

**Time needed:** 2-3 minutes per team = ~50 minutes for 17-game jackpot

## Form vs Head-to-Head: Which Matters More?

**Short answer:** Both matter, but in different situations.

**When form matters more:**
- Teams haven't played each other recently (12+ months)
- Significant squad changes since last meeting
- Manager change for one or both teams

**When H2H matters more:**
- Psychological blocks (one team always struggles vs another)
- Tactical matchup consistently favors one side
- Recent meetings (within 6 months)
