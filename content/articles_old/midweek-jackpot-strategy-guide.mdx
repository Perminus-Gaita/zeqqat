## Why Midweek is Different

Wednesday fixtures have unique characteristics that weekend games don't.

## Key Differences

### 1. Squad Rotation
Teams playing Thursday/Sunday often rest key players midweek.

**Impact:** More upsets, less predictable results

### 2. Motivation Varies
Teams fighting relegation prioritize weekend games over midweek cups.

**Impact:** Check what's at stake for each team

### 3. Lower Leagues Featured
Midweek often includes Championship, Serie B, Ligue 2.

**Impact:** Higher draw rates (28-31% vs 23-27% in top leagues)

## Midweek-Specific Strategy

**Research Focus:**
1. Check team news for rotation
2. Identify which teams have important weekend fixtures
3. Look for motivated teams (cup runs, promotion battles)
4. Expect more draws in lower leagues
