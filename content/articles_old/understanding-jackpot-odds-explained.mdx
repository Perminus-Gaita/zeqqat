## Why Are Jackpot Odds So Bad?

**Simple answer:** Because you need to predict 17 independent events correctly.

## The Basic Calculation

Each game has 3 outcomes: Home (1), Draw (X), Away (2)

**For 17 games:**
- Total combinations: 3^17 = 129,140,163
- Your entry: 1 combination
- **Odds: 1 in 129,140,163**

## What Actually Improves Odds

**What DOESN'T work:**
❌ Betting more money on same picks
❌ Using "lucky numbers"
❌ Following patterns in past results

**What DOES work:**
✅ Research (improving per-game accuracy from 33% to 55%)
✅ Double chance (covering more combinations)
✅ Syndicates (placing multiple different entries)
