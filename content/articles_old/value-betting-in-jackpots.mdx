## What is Value Betting?

A bet has value when the **true probability** of an outcome is higher than what the **bookmaker's odds** imply.

## Jackpot Context

In jackpots, you're not betting against bookmaker odds directly, but value thinking still applies.

**Question:** Is this team's **actual** win probability higher than market consensus?

## How to Find Value

**Step 1:** Check bookmaker odds (e.g., Arsenal to win = 1.50 odds = 66.7% implied probability)

**Step 2:** Do your own analysis (form, H2H, injuries)

**Step 3:** Estimate YOUR probability (e.g., you think Arsenal wins 75% of the time)

**Step 4:** If your estimate > market consensus, there's value
