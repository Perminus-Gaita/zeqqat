## What is a Jackpot Syndicate?

A group of bettors who **pool money** to place multiple entries, improving collective odds.

## The Math: Why Syndicates Work

**Solo Bettor:**
- Budget: KSh 100/week
- Entries: 1
- Odds: 1 in 129M

**10-Person Syndicate:**
- Budget: KSh 1,000/week (KSh 100 each)
- Entries: 10
- Odds: 1 in 12.9M (10× better)
- Prize split: 10 ways

## How to Start One

**Step 1:** Find 5-10 trusted friends/colleagues
**Step 2:** Agree on rules (contribution, split, decision-making)
**Step 3:** Set up M-Pesa collection (one person manages)
**Step 4:** Place bets weekly
**Step 5:** Track all entries transparently
